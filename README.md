## Cookiecutter Python Project Template

This is a `cookiecutter` Python project template that you can use to create new projects.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.12+
* `cookiecutter` that can be installed with `pip` or `conda`

```
$ pip install cookiecutter
# or
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```

### Create new project
```
cookiecutter https://github.com/dinhuun/python_project_template.git
project_name: your project name, Enter
project_slug: your project slug, Enter
author_name: author name, Enter
author_email: author email, Enter
description: description, Enter
open_source_license: 1/2/3, Enter
```
and a new project `project_slug` will be created in current directory.

It will look like this
```
project_name               <- top level
